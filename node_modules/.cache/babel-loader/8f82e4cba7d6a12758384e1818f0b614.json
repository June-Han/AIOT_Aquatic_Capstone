It is \r\n            also for detection of signs of coral bleaching for early mitigation through the use of machine learning and \r\n            cloud computing. The project also provides data visualization for condition of coral reefs worldwide.\r\n            This would aid in the fast release of results which is an important outcome for policymakers\r\n            who requires reliable data for decision making and also for scientists who need data from widespread area to \r\n            understand the impact of climate change on coral reefs. <br/><br/>\r\n\r\n            This project is created as a final year project for B.Sc(Hons) Computing Science at \r\n            SIT(Singapore Institute of Technology) and UOG(University of Glasgow) Joint Degree Programme. <br/><br/>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <h2 style=\"text-align: left; margin: auto\">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: </h2>\r\n        <div id=\"UNGoals\">\r\n            This project mainly aims to aid the following UN Sustainable Development Goals:\r\n            <ul>\r\n                <li>Goal 2: Zero Hunger</li>\r\n                <li>Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitization</li>\r\n                <li>Goal 14: Life Below Water</li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>    \r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  name: 'projectInfo',\r\n  props: {\r\n    msg: String,\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<style scoped>\r\n#description {\r\n    text-align: left;\r\n    padding: 20px;\r\n    margin-right: 120px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#UNGoals{\r\n    text-align: left;\r\n    padding: 20px;\r\n    margin-right: 120px;\r\n}\r\n</style>"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
