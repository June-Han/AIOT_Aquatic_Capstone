# Make machine learning predictions with TensorFlow and Azure Functions

* Train and export an image classifier that predicts whether a photo contains a dog or a cat using Azure Custom Vision Service
* Use TensorFlow to apply the model to input images in a Python Azure Function
* Create an HTTP API for predicting cat or dog
* Consume the HTTP API from a web page

This is a sample application that you can use to follow along with the tutorial at 
[Make machine learning predictions with TensorFlow and Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-machine-learning-tensorflow?WT.mc_id=functionspython-github-antchu).
